This document lists the features of the Wolfson 'Arizona' class audio hubs
supported by the kernel drivers (WM8997, WM5102, WM8280, WM8281).
Note that some features are covered by other classes of driver (extcon,
regulator, etc.) and this list below shows the full set of features related

Notes:
1. Integration-time configuration. Not possible to change at runtime
2. TDM is only possible if host I2S controller and I2S driver support TDM
    The set_tdm_slot() function is implemented to enable configuration of the
    slot size and which slots the codec will use. Codec channels are mapped in
    ascending order to the active slots - for example if the active TX slots in
    the I2S frame are 0, 1, and 7 then they will be mapped
    0->AIFTX1 1->AIFTX2 7->AIFTX3
3. Currently limited to set of known firmwares
4. Limited control of domain 2/3 frequency
5. Configured in ASoC machine driver
6. Firmware can be set by host but cannot be changed while ADSP is powered-up,
        it must be removed from an active path to power-down and the new
        firmware will be loaded when it is next powered-up as part of an
        active path
7. Configuration from device tree is work-in-progress so there may be some
        pdata settings that have not yet been migrated to device tree
9. The list of firmwares selectable by the "DSPn Firmware" ALSA controls is
        configurable via pdata or device tree


How firmwares are loaded
========================
The driver exposes an ALSA control to set the firmware for each ADSP on the
codec. These are named:

    DSP1 Firmware
    DSP2 Firmware
    ... etc.

The control is an enumeration of the available firmwares by function. It does
not directly set the actual filename of the firmware to be loaded. The mapping
between control values and actual firmware filename can be found in the file
sound/soc/codecs/wm_adsp.c

Setting this control tells the driver what firmware to load WHEN THE ADSP IS
NEXT POWERED UP. Setting the control does not force the firmware to be loaded
immediately, nor does it reboot the ADSP if it is currently running a different
firmware.

To load a firmware, or to reboot the ADSP with different firmware you must:
    - Disconnect the ADSP from any active audio path so that it will be powered-down
    - Set the firmware control to the firmware you want to load
    - Connect the ADSP to an active audio path so it will be powered-up

Firmware files can have an associated file called a "bin file". This has the
same name as the firmware file, but with the extension .bin, and goes in the
same directory as the firmware file. The bin file contains settings to be
patched in the ADSP memory after the firmware has been loaded. When the driver
loads a firmware it will look for a bin file and if found will apply the patches
from that bin file.

The purpose of the bin file is to allow tuning data to be applied to the firmware
without the need to rebuild the firmware to include this data. For example,
some audio algorithms must be tuned to the acoustic properties of the enclosure
the microphones or speakers are in - it would be impractical to build a new
firmware for each device with its unique parameters; instead the device is tuned
and the tuning data is put into the bin file.

The bin file is not intended for setting parameters that are runtime-modifiable,
such as volume controls, since the bin file is a one-shot set of parameters
that are patched when the firmware is loaded. Runtime modifiable controls should
be exposed by the firmware as such and the driver will create ALSA controls for
them.
